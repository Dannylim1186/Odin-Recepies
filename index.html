        Hey ya'll! My name is lazy mantau. If you dont know what <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantou">mantau</a> is, well.. basically it's just steamed bun. 
        I'm here to show you how to cook quick meal with very minimal effort for you lazy people, so you can get back to your precious anime or kdrama episode.
        Pls note that the ultimate lazy way to get decent food magically appear was whipped out that smart phone and order it from food delivery services.
        But that was for rich-lazy 1%er. This recipes designed for you broke-lazy who strugles financially and don't have alot of options.
